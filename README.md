# KPMG Data Analysis - Virtual Internship
In this virtual internship, I got the opportunity to complete similar work that the Graduates do at KPMG. Had a wonderful experience in learning what it is like to work at one of the worldâ€™s best data analytics team, and building my skills required to excel as an analytics consultant.

The virtual internship has three components:
* Data Quality Assessment
  * This part includes the assessment of data quality and completeness in preparation for analysis
  
* Data Insights
  * Targeting high value customers based on customer demographics and attributes.

* Data Insights and Presentation
  * Using visualisations to present insights
